### Astronomy Repositories

[**Vizier**](http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR)
[**NED**](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/)

- Accepts data from published papers where provance is known.
- Strict formatting rules, which enable API data access.

**High Level Science Archives (NASA)**

- [MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/)
- [IRSA](http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/)
- [Chandra Data Archive](http://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/)

### Domain Independent Data Repositories

There are three  "domain" independent data repositories that you should know about. They have the following characteristics:

- Mints DOIs for "heterogenous" data sets.
- Public and Private "permissions" for datasets.
- API for data upload and discoverability.

Some worthwhile differences are

User Interfaces
:  figshare and zenodo have gone for very simplified user interfaces while dataverse is rebuilding their UI, which was originally based on very rich metadata (Version 4 to be released in Spring 2014).

Data Viewers
: The ability to view or embed your data in a repository varies from tool to tool. figshare has some of the best data viewers, including one for FITS files and cubes.

[**figshare**](http://figshare.com/about)

- Has builtin FITS image viewer
- Great Social Networking and Data Set Viewers
- Supported by Nature Publishing

- Collections features
- Supported by CERN/EU

[**dataverse**](http://thedata.harvard.edu/) 

* Indexes FITS header keywords for search
* Supported by Harvard

### Exercise 

Create an account on one of these services and upload a dataset.
