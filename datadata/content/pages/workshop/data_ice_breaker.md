This exercise is intended to get you thinking about the data products that are created as part of your research. 

Here is what you need to do: 

- You need to pair up. If there are an odd number of us, then there will be 1 three person team.
- Your team has 30 minutes to "review" each other's papers and discover the data behind them. 
- Goal is to find the other person's paper's data, describe it, and decide what should be done with it.

Use this survey to keep track of your notes during this data interview.
