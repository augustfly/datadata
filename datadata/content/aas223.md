Summary: Welcome AAS Attendees.

I will be running the *"Managing, Sharing, and Archiving Your Data"* professional development workshop for attendees of the [AAS 223 meeting](http://aas.org/meetings/223rd-aas-meeting-washington-dc) in National Harbor, MD on Sunday, January 5, 2014. This is one of [many of the professional development activities](http://www.astrobetter.com/professional-development-at-the-2014-winter-aas-meeting/) sponsored or supported by [the AAS Committee on Employment](http://aas.org/comms/committee-employment). 

Here is the block summary: 

>>Astronomers use, peruse and produce vast amounts of scientific data. Managing these data consumes a great deal research effort. Making these data publicly available is important because it supports the reproducibility of results. Archiving these data ensures their long term preservation and reuse. This workshop will introduce participants to some tools to tackle the problem of managing, sharing, and archiving their data. Specific topics covered will include funding agency data management requirements, data-literature connections such as how to best cite data in your paper, online tools for preserving and sharing data, and desktop tools for managing data. The instructor will be [August Muench](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~gmuench/) (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory). Participant Requirements: Participants at all stages of their career are welcome, and there are no prerequisites. Participants should bring their own laptops in order to participate in hands on tutorials with specific data archiving tools and websites. 

You can follow along with the [workshop curriculum]({filename}/pages/workshop/aas223_workshop.md) materials.
